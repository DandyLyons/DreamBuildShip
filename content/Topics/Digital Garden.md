A Digital Garden is an online space that combines elements of a notebook and a blog, where individuals cultivate and share their thoughts publicly. Unlike traditional blogs with articles that have a publication date and start decaying over time, digital gardens are evergreen, allowing gardeners to continuously edit and refine their notes. These spaces are characterized by bi-directional linking, connecting notes together to create a trail of ideas that readers can follow, promoting exploration based on interest rather than chronology. Digital gardens are lightweight platforms that prioritize the content itself, offering flexibility in design to reflect the owner's thinking style and preferences. They can be built using various tools, from simple no-code platforms like Obsidian Publish or Notion to more customizable options like Jekyll or Gatsby for those with technical skills. Overall, digital gardens serve as personal collections of ideas, fostering creativity, knowledge sharing, and community interaction in a less performative and more collaborative online environment.
