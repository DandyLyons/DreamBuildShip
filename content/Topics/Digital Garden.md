A Digital Garden is an online space that combines elements of a notebook and a blog, where individuals cultivate and share their thoughts publicly. Unlike traditional blogs with articles that have a publication date and start decaying over time, digital gardens are evergreen, allowing gardeners to continuously edit and refine their notes[2][3][5]. These spaces are characterized by bi-directional linking, connecting notes together to create a trail of ideas that readers can follow, promoting exploration based on interest rather than chronology[5]. Digital gardens are lightweight platforms that prioritize the content itself, offering flexibility in design to reflect the owner's thinking style and preferences[5]. They can be built using various tools, from simple no-code platforms like Obsidian Publish or Notion to more customizable options like Jekyll or Gatsby for those with technical skills[5]. Overall, digital gardens serve as personal collections of ideas, fostering creativity, knowledge sharing, and community interaction in a less performative and more collaborative online environment[2][3][5].
