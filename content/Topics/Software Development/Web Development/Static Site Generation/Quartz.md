## My Explorations

### How do I show both "created date" and "modified date"? 
- [Discord: What's the best way to add both date of publication and last modified date under the title?](https://discord.com/channels/927628110009098281/1136918563400200202/1171037494201028639) 

## How do I implement RSS feed filtering? 
Problem: I would like to generate an RSS feed, via Quartz that includes some, but not all of the pages.

### How do I implement opt-in publishing across the entire vault? 
Problem: I don't want to have a separate quartz vault and personal vault. I want just one vault, and I only want to publish select files to quartz.
